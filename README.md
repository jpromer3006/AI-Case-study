 "Hi Juan,Thanks for the call today and great catching up. Do you have times that work 2 weeks out during the Tuesday 4/2-4/4 Thursday time frame that might work or you? I'll try to sync up with;your calendar.I have some materials, a recap of our call and some questions that will help me connect with the solution architects and in preparation for our next call. First, here are a couple of resources. 
 
 1) is an insurance overview document that discusses the work we do around claims for major insurers and is similar to your workflow. They all are a bit different, but can be customized to your exact needs with the tools you use, and then configured easily and quickly along the way because it's a no-code platform. 

2) I have in mind something similar in structure to what the logistics company we just onboarded has, where they interact through a dashboard internally rather than expert system.  A type portal that connects to another system they use (similar to you using Origami) to display that data, click on the cases and trigger a workflow with automated emails
 
 >Insurance Claims Workflow On the recap,
 
  I'm simplifying it but essentially you're receiving a number of emails with attachments from 50-100 different departments that you must categorize via Outlook, review, and then route to other parties with a memo that includes the RCN# in the email subject header, the appropriate parties based on the RCN# and other data values that reside in Origami with information on the outcome of the case, benefits, timekeeping, etc. Then you need to receive an email back with a receipt of the timekeeping that will be posted back into Origami to close out the case. You also mentioned the chatbot use case example, if you can please expand on that and clarify/correct anything I've written above?
  
  What I envision is you engaging with customized dashboard that you/your team designed that shows all the cases and the data being pulled from Origami to manage in one place. Then as you receive them on the dashboard, you can click on them, they contain the RCN# identifier and all the data you need and generate an automated email copying all the parties who need to receive this email you're routing with the next steps. And then an email back from the recipient with a link maybe where you can post right back into Origami and close the case. Just not clear again where the chatbot workflow fits here.All of this is adjustable easily when you build it on a no-code platform and can be scaled to add more workflows that you mentioned take prior to your piece and after that would definitely reduce the manual hours spent across multiple tasks at NYCT and drive efficiency via this digital transformation. Then GenAI can always be layered on to parts of the process where it's deemed necessary and can further enhance a process.I also wanted to confirm. Is this the Origami tool you're using? their API documentation so we put an inquiry in. This is what will help us integrate and pull the fields we'll need for your solution. You can also connect us with the Admin at Origami so we can see whether you have access through some type of admin account.
  
  Finally, this all seems exciting and the ROI return will be great if we're converting hours of work into minutes, but please let me =
know if the $45K price ($3750 monthly) is something that is within NYCT's budget 

Please feel free to send along any questions as they come up or give me a call

Thanks again Juan
